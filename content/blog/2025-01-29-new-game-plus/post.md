A new year, a new life, a new blog.

Becoming a parent is such a radical change in life. One I couldn't possibly anticipate. Your old self dies, in a way, and you are reborn as a different person. One with different priorities and views and life, with different occupations, even a different body. I use to tell people that to me, becoming a mother feels like [a new game plus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Game_Plus): your game ends, and you get to replay it (from a passenger seat) from the very beginning, but keeping all your accumulated experience and items.

When you work with technology, the change is particularly disruptive. All of a sudden, you go from spending most of your time typing on a pc to nursing a baby at all times. You go from reading tutorials and documentation to reading parenting books to try and figure out this unintuitive little creature. From attending tech talks, to doctor checkups, from hanging with other geeks, to joining normie mom groups. 

At first, I thought this change would be temporary. Just while the baby is small. Maybe a few months. Turns out, babies take some more time to become less dependant than what is usually advertised. But that's ok: there'll always be time to go back to my old life - I thought to myself.

Except, that's not that easy when your old life was all about technology. Technology moves incredibly fast, particularly web development. In what felt like the blink of an eye, JS spawned not just a few frameworks but a whole new language, we have like 3 different new package managers in ubuntu, and there's now a magical genie that writes all the code for you. The more time you spend out of the loop, the more detached you become, and that makes it harder still to come back. A cursed cycle.

It's been several years new, more that I would like to admit. And despite having a ton of experience in the field, I do feel a bit like a beginner: I have a million new things to learn, and I'm even struggling using the technologies I already new. And let's not even talk about applying to jobs... It feels somehow like my career is back to square one.

But I'd like to look at it from an optimist angle: I have my experience, my knowledge, and my wits. And the magical genie that is taking our jobs and souls can be harnessed as a powerful weapon too. It's not a new game: it's new game plus.
