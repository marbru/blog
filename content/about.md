# About

Hello! My name is Mar Bartolomé, and this is where I sing my personal thoughts and ramblings for those who care to stop and listen.

As you can probably guess, I am a huge geek, and I enjoy playing D&D: when I do, I become _Marion the Bard_, adventuring minstrel extraordinaire.

[Bards in D&D](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/bard) are jack-of-all-trades support characters - they can do some spells, or focus on physical attacks depending on the subclass, but where they really shine is in buffing and supporting the rest of the party. [_Bardic inspiration_](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Bardic%20Inspiration#content) is a core ability of bards that results in more favorable die rolls for those who get inspired.

So that is exactly what I intend with my writing: to inspire and empower those around me.

In the [Real World](https://matrix.fandom.com/wiki/Real_World), my main occupation is being a software developer. I offer my services as a freelancer ([you can hire me!](https://coconauts.net/)), but also I love coding my own projects for fun, and sharing them with the world in [my other blog](https://coconauts.net/blog/). I am a big advocate for the [free/open source software culture](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-intro.html), and just freedom and community in general. 

My other main occupation is being a mom: I am happily married and have two amazing kids, which fill my life with love and joy every single minute. 

I have way too many hobbies for my own good, but if I have to feature some, I'd say music (I'm a classically trained pianist) and videogames (particularly retro or indie). But as I mentioned before, I just enjoy anything geeky (movies, series, books...).
