# Bardic inspiration blog

This is my personal blog, built with eleventy and based on the [https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog](eleventy-base-blog v9) starter template.

## Development

Install deps:

```
npm install
```

Generate a production-ready build to the `_site` folder:

```
npx @11ty/eleventy
```

Or build and host on a local development server:

```
npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
```

Or you can run [debug mode](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/debugging/) to see all the internals.
